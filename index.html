    <p>9-2-22 -- Today we had a CAD challenge 
    where we were challenged to create a house 
    applieance in cad. We also began to create 
    our Rube Goldberg Machine.</p>
    <p>9-9-22 -- This week we continued to model and redesign 
    our Rube Goldberg machines </p>
    <p>9-16-22 -- We continued to build and remodel our 
    Rube Goldberg machines to help them work better and 
    function smoother. we have almost finished fully building 
    and almost ready to test</p>
    <p>9-23-22 -- Today we finished building and 
    tested our Rube Goldberg Machine and it worked first
    try. We tryed several times and remodeled the design 
    several times.</p>

    <p>9-30-22 -- We have tested our machine and just need to 
    update our websites. I've tryed to add an image but it 
    doesnt seem to work properly.</p>
    <p>10-7-22 -- We were given a presentation on our next 
    short unit of Bioengineering and learned about what a 
    Bioengineer does.</p>
    <P>10-13-22 -- We had a challenge day today, the challenge 
    was to make an object out of a single piece of paper that 
    will be launched from a balcony and be the closest to a 
    bin on the main level.</P>
    <p>10-19-22 -- We spent the day building our bottle rockets
    based off of the cads and previous designs.</p>

    <P>10-21-22 -- Today we launched our bottle rockets and 
    ours was not the best, then again, none of them were good.</P>
    <p>10-25-22 -- We started our next unit, Enviornmental 
    Engineering. We also have updated our websites.</p>
    <p>11-4-22  -- New month, new unit. we started our 
    Electrical engineering unit. I dont like circuits, i mean it's 
    actually interesting to learn, but i dont like doing the
    circuit building. And updating websites is so so. We've learned
    about circuits in Series and Parallel.</p>
    <p>11-10-22 -- We started working with real breadboards. They 
    are interesting and I have learned a lot from using them.</p>
