    <p>9-2-22 -- Today we had a CAD challenge 
    where we were challenged to create a house 
    applieance in cad. We also began to create 
    our Rube Goldberg Machine.</p>
    <p>9-9-22 -- This week we continued to model and redesign 
    our Rube Goldberg machines </p>
    <p>9-16-22 -- We continued to build and remodel our 
    Rube Goldberg machines to help them work better and 
    function smoother. we have almost finished fully building 
    and almost ready to test</p>
    <p>9-23-22 -- Today we finished building and 
    tested our Rube Goldberg Machine and it worked first
    try. We tryed several times and remodeled the design 
    several times.</p>
    <p>9-30-22 -- We have tested our machine and just need to 
    update our websites. I've tryed to add an image but it 
    doesnt seem to work properly.</p>
    <p>10-7-22 -- We were given a presentation on our next 
    short unit of Bioengineering and learned about what a 
    Bioengineer does.</p>
    <P>10-13-22 -- We had a challenge day today, the challenge 
    was to make an object out of a single piece of paper that 
    will be launched from a balcony and be the closest to a 
    bin on the main level.</P>
    <p>10-19-22 -- We spent the day building our bottle rockets
    based off of the cads and previous designs.</p>

    <P>10-21-22 -- Today we launched our bottle rockets and 
    ours was not the best, then again, none of them were good.</P>
    <p>10-25-22 -- We started our next unit, Enviornmental 
    Engineering. We also have updated our websites.</p>
    <p>11-4-22  -- New month, new unit. we started our 
    Electrical engineering unit. I dont like circuits, i 
    mean it's actually interesting to learn, but i dont like 
    doing the circuit building. And updating websites is so so. 
    We've learned about circuits in Series and Parallel.</p>
    <p>11-10-22 -- We started working with real breadboards. They 
    are interesting and I have learned a lot from using them.</p>
    <p>3-7-23 -- For the past 6 weeks, our class has been on
    a mission to design, build, and create a Mouse-Trap Car. The
    idea was to build a simple car out of cardboard, DVDs and 
    tape that would be used as a mount for a mouse trap. The idea
    was that the mouse trap spring would be connected to a string
    connecting to the wheels of the car and, when triggered, the
    spring would pull the string attatched to the wheels of the 
    car, forcing them to spin and propel the car forward. My car
    design was to have a big singular wheel in the back of the
    car used to maximum distance using a big gear ratio. We 
    attempted to make a single rear wheel but the mouse trap was
    uneven and in it's force and it would lean the wheel to the 
    left or right. My partner and I tried to add another string
    to the opposite side of the wheel to help balance it out and 
    prevent the wheel from leaning to one side. This helped slightly
    but also revealed a new problem, the  strings had to be perfectly 
    alined and released at the perfect time. The added string also 
    pulled the wheel up into the axle creating friction and preventing
    the wheel from moving. To help with the friction: we added small 
    slices of a straw around the inside of the axle, repositioned 
    the string and resized it before each test run. </p>

    <p>4-25-23 -- For the past few weeks, mu group and I have 
    been collecting and cutting our pieces of cardboard in preparation 
    for when we recieve the duch tape needed to connect the cardboard 
    pieces and begin the actual production of our boats.</p>
    <img src="Boat cad.png" width="450" height="350">
    <p>5-1-23 -- In collection of the cardboard and in preparation
    for the duck tape, my group and I have decided to redesign our boat
    and add a small compartment beneath the surface of the water to
    help keep our center of gravity low and to assure ourselves that the
    boat will stay on the water and not tip or go above the surface.</p>
    <p>5-15-23 -- In the past few weeks, we have made great progress on 
    our boat. We have been able to piece together our cardboard and have
    started to create the lining on the inside and outside of the boat to 
    prevent water from entering our water vessle. We did have to reenforce
    the ductape holding the boat together because it had previously broken
    apart. Last friday on the 12th, we were given the task to create a 
    "water rollercoaster" which is a track made of paper that would create
    a path for a marble or ball to go down. </p>
